# Job-Scrape

Job-Scrape is an application that automatically retrieves job listings data from [indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com) based on a given job title, zip code, and number of pages to search. With this data, the application creates a CSV (excel) file that neatly formats this data. The data retrieved includes each job listing's:
- Company Name
- Job Title
- Job Location
- Job Application Link (whether "Apply on Indeed" or a Company Page redirect link)
